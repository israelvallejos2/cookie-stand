                    <h3>History about Salmon Cookies</h3>
                    <p>
                        A cookie is a baked or cooked snack or dessert that is typically small, flat and sweet. It
                        usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other
                        ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.
                        In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crunchy cookies are called
                        biscuits. Many Canadians also use this term. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even
                        in the United Kingdom.[3] Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or
                        bars.Biscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as custard creams, Jammie Dodgers,
                        Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another
                        sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea and sometimes
                        "dunked", an approach which releases more flavour from confections by dissolving the sugars,[4]
                        while also softening their texture. Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience
                        stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses, with the
                        latter ranging from small business-sized establishments to multinational corporations such as
                        Starbucks.
